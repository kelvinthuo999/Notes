# Software Engineering
- Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing and deploying softwares to meet specific needs or solve particular problems.

## Roles and responsibilities

Some of the tasks and responsibilities include:
1. Gather and analyze the user requirements of a software
2. Use programming languages to design and build software systems.
3. Test, debug, troubleshoot, and maintain software systems.
4. Optimize code for performance, speed, and scalability.
5. Create flowcharts, documentation for finding solutions.
6. Work with different teams of diferent organizations.

## Specialization

- My main area of interest are backend development and mobile development.
- Backend development involves building and maintaining parts of websites 
and web applications that users don't see and interact with.
- Backend development deals with databases, web architecture, servers, 
user authentication, authorization, handling and processing user requests.

### Abstract notes

- I need to learn how to learn in order to pick up anything faster and make it stick.
- One technique is active recall which involves quizzing myself and recalling main ideas.
- Another technique is spaced repetition which flattens the forgetting curve.
- To be an expert software engineer, I will need to have in-depth of at least one or two 
or more programming languages. I choose to study C and Python in depth. 
- Java and Javascript will be the next step after the two.

## Data structure and algorithms
