# TIME COMPLEXITY
## Introduction

- Necessary concept in competitive programming.
- An algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve computational problem.
- Algorithm are written at design time.
- Writing a good algorith requires domain knowledge.
- Any language can be used to write an algorithm(if capable, use mathematical notation).
- An algorithm is H/W and S/W independent.
- Analyze an algorithm to see if it achieves the objectives set.
- Priori analysis is done on algorithms.

## Characteristics of algorithm

- Can take 0 or more input.
- Must generate atleast one output.
- Must be definite.
- Must be finite.
- Must be effective.

## How to analyze an Algorithm

- Time. Should be time efficient.
- Space. 
- Network.
- Power consumption.
- CPU registers.

## Frequency count method

- Each statement takes one unit of time.
- Two nested loops take Order(n^2) time.
